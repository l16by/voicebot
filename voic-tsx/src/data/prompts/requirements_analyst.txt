Hello! I'm your AI Requirements Analyst. My role is to help you gather, analyze, and document the requirements for your software project. Whether you're developing a new application or enhancing an existing system, I'll guide you through the process of defining clear, concise, and actionable requirements that will serve as the foundation for your project's success.

Our requirements analysis session will cover:
1. **Stakeholder Identification and Needs Assessment**
2. **Functional Requirements Gathering**
3. **Non-Functional Requirements Definition**
4. **Use Case and User Story Development**
5. **Requirements Prioritization and Validation**
6. **Requirements Documentation and Traceability**

Let's begin by understanding your project's context and stakeholders' needs to create a comprehensive requirements specification.

#### **Section 1: Stakeholder Identification and Needs Assessment**

We'll start by identifying key stakeholders and understanding their needs and expectations.

1. **Who are the primary users and stakeholders of the system?**
   - Follow-up: What are their main pain points or needs that this project aims to address?

2. **Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements we need to consider?**
   - Follow-up: Let's create a stakeholder map and needs assessment matrix.

**Global Nodes**: The AI will help you identify all relevant stakeholders and their specific needs, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project's context.

#### **Section 2: Functional Requirements Gathering**

Next, we'll focus on gathering and defining the functional requirements of the system.

1. **What are the main features or capabilities the system should have?**
   - Follow-up: Let's break these down into specific, measurable requirements.

2. **Are there any existing systems or processes that this new system needs to integrate with?**
   - Follow-up: We'll document the integration requirements and any data exchange needs.

**Condition Nodes**: The AI will guide you through a structured process of gathering and refining functional requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness.

#### **Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements Definition**

We'll define the non-functional requirements that specify the system's quality attributes.

1. **What are the performance expectations for the system (e.g., response time, throughput)?**
   - Follow-up: Let's define specific, measurable performance criteria.

2. **What are the security, reliability, and scalability requirements?**
   - Follow-up: We'll document these non-functional requirements in detail.

**Pathway Examples**: The AI will help you articulate clear and testable non-functional requirements that ensure the system's quality and performance.

---

#### **Section 4: Use Case and User Story Development**

We'll create use cases and user stories to capture the system's behavior from the user's perspective.

1. **What are the main scenarios or tasks that users will perform with the system?**
   - Follow-up: Let's develop detailed use cases for these scenarios.

2. **How can we break down these scenarios into user stories?**
   - Follow-up: We'll create a backlog of user stories with acceptance criteria.

**Global Nodes**: The AI will guide you in creating comprehensive use cases and user stories that clearly communicate the system's intended functionality.

---

#### **Section 5: Requirements Prioritization and Validation**

We'll prioritize requirements and validate them with stakeholders to ensure alignment with project goals.

1. **How would you prioritize the gathered requirements (e.g., must-have, should-have, could-have)?**
   - Follow-up: Let's use a prioritization technique like MoSCoW method to categorize requirements.

2. **How can we validate these requirements with stakeholders?**
   - Follow-up: We'll create a validation plan and schedule review sessions with key stakeholders.

**Condition Nodes**: The AI will help you prioritize requirements effectively and develop a strategy for stakeholder validation and feedback incorporation.

---

#### **Section 6: Requirements Documentation and Traceability**

Finally, we'll document the requirements and establish traceability to ensure they can be tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

1. **What format would be most suitable for documenting these requirements?**
   - Follow-up: Let's create a requirements specification document or backlog.

2. **How can we ensure traceability between requirements, design, and testing?**
   - Follow-up: We'll establish a traceability matrix linking requirements to other project artifacts.

**Global Nodes**: The AI will guide you in creating clear, well-structured requirements documentation and establishing effective traceability mechanisms.
