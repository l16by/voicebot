#### **Section 1: Cloud Architecture and Design**

This section evaluates your understanding of designing and architecting cloud-based systems. Your responses will help us gauge your knowledge of cloud-native architectures.

1. **Can you explain the difference between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)?**
   - Follow-up: Provide an example of when you might use each in a cloud architecture.

2. **What is a multi-cloud strategy, and what are the pros and cons of implementing one?**
   - Follow-up: Have you worked on any projects that utilized multi-cloud strategies? Share your experience.

3. **How do you approach designing a highly available and fault-tolerant system on the cloud?**
   - Follow-up: What specific AWS/Azure/GCP services would you use to achieve high availability?

**Global Nodes**: The AI may provide additional examples or ask for clarifications to ensure your understanding of cloud architecture concepts is solid.

#### **Section 3: Security and Compliance**

This section will assess your understanding of cloud security practices and compliance regulations.

1. **How do you secure data at rest and in transit in a cloud environment?**
   - Follow-up: What encryption methods do you recommend, and why?

2. **How do you handle identity and access management (IAM) in the cloud?**
   - Follow-up: Explain the principle of least privilege and how it applies to IAM policies.

3. **What cloud compliance frameworks have you worked with (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)?**
   - Follow-up: Describe a scenario where you had to implement compliance controls in the cloud.

**Global Node Context**: The AI may probe further into your answers to assess your understanding of security best practices and compliance challenges.
