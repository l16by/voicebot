# Dynamic Intent and Tool Selection

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the dynamic intent and tool selection feature in the AI-Powered Phone Conversation Bot application.

## Overview

The dynamic intent and tool selection feature allows the AI to adapt its behavior based on user input and prerequisites. This enables more personalized and context-aware interactions during phone conversations.

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Intent Recognition**: The AI can recognize user intents dynamically based on the conversation flow. This is achieved by analyzing user input and matching it with predefined intents.

2. **Tool Selection**: Based on the recognized intent, the AI can select appropriate tools to assist in the conversation. For example, if the user is discussing scheduling, the AI can integrate with a calendly tool to provide available times.

3. **Conversation Flow**: The AI adapts the conversation flow based on the recognized intents and selected tools. This ensures that the conversation remains relevant and helpful to the user.

## Instructions

### Setting Up

1. **Update `app.py`**: Ensure that the `app.py` file includes the necessary logic for dynamic intent recognition and tool selection. This involves updating the `INTERVIEW_PROMPTS` dictionary and integrating additional tools and intents into the conversation flow.

2. **Update `templates/home.html`**: Enhance the user interface to support dynamic intent and tool selection. This includes adding necessary elements to display dynamic prompts and tool suggestions.

### Using the Feature

1. **Select Interview Type**: On the homepage, select the desired interview type from the dropdown menu. This will load the corresponding prompt and set the initial context for the conversation.

2. **Start the Call**: Enter your phone number and click the "Start Call" button. The AI will initiate the phone call and begin the conversation based on the selected interview type.

3. **Dynamic Interaction**: During the call, the AI will dynamically recognize user intents and select appropriate tools to assist in the conversation. For example, if the user mentions scheduling, the AI may provide available times using the calendly tool.

### Examples and Use Cases

1. **Mock Interviews**: The AI can conduct mock interviews for various roles, such as cloud computing, sales, or HR. Based on the user's responses, the AI can adapt the conversation flow and provide relevant feedback.

2. **Personal Guidance**: The AI can offer personal guidance, such as therapy or counseling sessions. The AI can recognize user intents related to mental health and provide appropriate advice and resources.

3. **Business Scenarios**: The AI can assist in business scenarios, such as investor pitch preparation or entrepreneur coaching. The AI can recognize user intents related to business strategy and provide tailored advice.
