# Dynamic Intent and Tool Selection

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the dynamic intent and tool selection feature in the AI-Powered Phone Conversation Bot application.

## Overview

The dynamic intent and tool selection feature allows the AI to adapt its behavior based on user input and prerequisites. This enables more personalized and context-aware interactions during phone conversations.

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Intent Recognition**: The AI can recognize user intents dynamically based on the conversation flow. This is achieved by analyzing user input and matching it with predefined intents.

2. **Tool Selection**: Based on the recognized intent, the AI can select appropriate tools to assist in the conversation. For example, if the user is discussing scheduling, the AI can integrate with a calendly tool to provide available times.

3. **Conversation Flow**: The AI adapts the conversation flow based on the recognized intents and selected tools. This ensures that the conversation remains relevant and helpful to the user.

## Instructions

### Setting Up

1. **Update `app.py`**: Ensure that the `app.py` file includes the necessary logic for dynamic intent recognition and tool selection. This involves updating the `INTERVIEW_PROMPTS` dictionary and integrating additional tools and intents into the conversation flow.

2. **Update `templates/home.html`**: Enhance the user interface to support dynamic intent and tool selection. This includes adding necessary elements to display dynamic prompts and tool suggestions.

### Using the Feature

1. **Select Interview Type**: On the homepage, select the desired interview type from the dropdown menu. This will load the corresponding prompt and set the initial context for the conversation.

2. **Start the Call**: Enter your phone number and click the "Start Call" button. The AI will initiate the phone call and begin the conversation based on the selected interview type.

3. **Dynamic Interaction**: During the call, the AI will dynamically recognize user intents and select appropriate tools to assist in the conversation. For example, if the user mentions scheduling, the AI may provide available times using the calendly tool.

### Examples and Use Cases

1. **Mock Interviews**: The AI can conduct mock interviews for various roles, such as cloud computing, sales, or HR. Based on the user's responses, the AI can adapt the conversation flow and provide relevant feedback.

2. **Personal Guidance**: The AI can offer personal guidance, such as therapy or counseling sessions. The AI can recognize user intents related to mental health and provide appropriate advice and resources.

3. **Business Scenarios**: The AI can assist in business scenarios, such as investor pitch preparation or entrepreneur coaching. The AI can recognize user intents related to business strategy and provide tailored advice.

## Advanced Interaction Techniques

### Context-Aware Responses

The AI can provide context-aware responses by maintaining a conversation history and using it to inform its replies. This allows the AI to reference previous parts of the conversation and provide more relevant and coherent responses.

### Multi-Step Tasks

The AI can handle multi-step tasks by breaking down complex interactions into smaller, manageable steps. For example, scheduling an appointment can involve multiple steps such as checking availability, confirming details, and sending reminders.

### External Tool Integration

The AI can integrate with external tools like Calendly to enhance its capabilities. For example, the AI can use Calendly to provide available times for scheduling appointments and send confirmation emails.

## Step-by-Step Guidance

### Configuring the AI for Complex Scenarios

1. **Define Intents**: Create a list of predefined intents that the AI can recognize. These intents should cover various scenarios and user needs.

2. **Map Tools to Intents**: Associate each intent with the appropriate tools that the AI can use to assist in the conversation. For example, map the "scheduling" intent to the Calendly tool.

3. **Implement Context Management**: Develop a system for managing conversation context, allowing the AI to maintain a history of the conversation and use it to inform its responses.

4. **Handle Multi-Step Tasks**: Implement logic for breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps and guiding the user through each step.

5. **Integrate External Tools**: Set up integrations with external tools like Calendly to enhance the AI's capabilities. Ensure that the AI can interact with these tools seamlessly during the conversation.

## Advanced Options and Configuration

### Dynamic Intent and Tool Selection Configuration

1. **Custom Intents**: Define custom intents based on specific user needs and scenarios. This allows the AI to recognize a wider range of intents and provide more tailored responses.

2. **Tool Configuration**: Configure the tools that the AI can use based on the recognized intents. For example, integrate additional scheduling tools or CRM systems to enhance the AI's capabilities.

3. **Context Management Settings**: Adjust the settings for managing conversation context, such as the duration for which the context is maintained and the types of information that are stored.

4. **Multi-Step Task Configuration**: Customize the steps involved in multi-step tasks to match the specific requirements of the user. This ensures that the AI can handle complex interactions effectively.

5. **External Tool Integration Settings**: Configure the settings for integrating external tools, such as API keys, endpoints, and authentication methods. This ensures seamless interaction between the AI and external tools.

## Example Code and Functions

### Example Code for Dynamic Intent Recognition

```python
import re

# Define intents and corresponding patterns
INTENTS = {
    "greeting": re.compile(r"\b(hello|hi|hey)\b", re.IGNORECASE),
    "scheduling": re.compile(r"\b(schedule|appointment|book)\b", re.IGNORECASE),
    "feedback": re.compile(r"\b(feedback|review|comment)\b", re.IGNORECASE),
}

def recognize_intent(user_input):
    for intent, pattern in INTENTS.items():
        if pattern.search(user_input):
            return intent
    return "unknown"

# Example usage
user_input = "Can I schedule an appointment?"
recognized_intent = recognize_intent(user_input)
print(f"Recognized Intent: {recognized_intent}")
```

### Example Code for Tool Selection

```python
# Define tools and corresponding intents
TOOLS = {
    "scheduling": "Calendly",
    "feedback": "FeedbackForm",
}

def select_tool(intent):
    return TOOLS.get(intent, "DefaultTool")

# Example usage
selected_tool = select_tool(recognized_intent)
print(f"Selected Tool: {selected_tool}")
```

### Example Code for Context Management

```python
class ConversationContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def add_to_history(self, user_input, ai_response):
        self.history.append({"user_input": user_input, "ai_response": ai_response})

    def get_history(self):
        return self.history

# Example usage
context = ConversationContext()
context.add_to_history("Can I schedule an appointment?", "Sure, let me check available times.")
print(context.get_history())
```
